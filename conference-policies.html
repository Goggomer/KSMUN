        <div class="text-body">
            <p>
                Generally, all delegates should display good behaviour and refrain from doing anything that may be considered violent or disrespectful. Any and all of the following acts will result in consequential action:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Theft</li>
                <li>Found in possession or under the use of drugs/alcohol</li>
                <li>Violence</li>
                <li>Unnecessarily missing committee sessions (after reminders and warnings)</li>
                <li>Academic Dishonesty, which includes plagiarism as well as the use of AI tools to generate works</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Comedy and jokes are allowed provided that they are not hurtful to any person or group. Comedy is welcome as long as it does not negatively interfere with otherwise important procedures.
                All delegates are required to attend all committee sessions without reasonable reason and without informing either your committee staff members or the secretariat team.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h2 class="subheading">Technology Use Policy</h2>
        <div class="text-body">
            <p>During committee sessions, delegates are authorized to use electronic devices and the Internet for educational purposes only. Non-academic use of electronic devices and internet access (e.g., texting, gaming, etc.) is strictly prohibited at all times. Earbuds and other headphones are also not permitted unless pre-approved by the dais team or the Secretariat. According to the KSMUN Delegate Code of Conduct, staff personnel may request that delegates who violate this policy cease their disruptive and unproductive conduct, and they may suspend their technology access.

        <h2 class="subheading">Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
        <h2>What is Model United Nations?</h2>
        <div class="text-body">
            <p>Model United Nations (MUN) is a high school simulation of the United Nations. Delegates who attend the conference are assigned to represent a nation or person in a committee addressing global issues. The variety of committees allows delegates to debate a wide range of topics, from security to more imaginative scenarios involving magic. This experience helps delegates become more aware of the UN's functions and enables them to articulate their country’s stance on global events. Additionally, MUN teaches valuable skills, such as negotiating with others. Overall, Model UN provides an opportunity for delegates to investigate and debate pressing issues, fostering a deeper understanding of international relations and diplomacy.</p>
